# SQL

This is a Node.js playground for SQL queries

## Setup

- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Follow instructions in [POPULATE.md](POPULATE.md) to populate the database with the data from the CSV files

> Note: Use the `users.csv` file to populate the `users` table

## Usage

- Run `npm start` or `npm run dev` to start the server
- Edit the `index.js` file to write your SQL queries

> Note: You could also use the MySQL Workbench to run the queries. To open the MySQL Workbench, run `mysql -u root` (add the `-p` flag if you have a password). To exit the MySQL Workbench, run `exit`. Before running the queries, remember to select the database by running `USE test_db;`
